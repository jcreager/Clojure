# I like Clojure

Clojure is probably my favorite language at the moment.  For me, Clojure is the most fluent way to express complexity through simplicity.  In particular I find ClojureScript to be a wonderful abstraction over JavaScript.  Libraries like Reagent, Re-Frame (or Kee-Frame), and Dommy eliminate the friction between vision and implementation.  Contact me if you want to build something with Clojure or ClojureScript.
