# I like Clojure

Clojure is probably my favorite language at the moment.  For me, Clojure is the most fluent way to express complexity through simplicity.  In particular I find ClojureScript to be a wonderful abstraction over JavaScript.  Libraries like Reagent, Re-Frame (or Kee-Frame), and Dommy eliminate the friction between vision and implementation.  Contact me if you want to build something with Clojure or ClojureScript.

# Projects I have done with Clojure

These are living projects you can look at today.

### cvreactor

[app.cvreactor.com](https://app.cvreactor.com/)

I built `cvreactor` because I needed a way to edit and share my `tex` based resume.  This app let's you edit your resume with one unique URL and share a preview of the output with another unique URL.  It is made with Clojure and ClojureScript using the Re-Frame library, PDFJS, and bootstrap.  Storage is backed by MongoDB.  I host this app in my Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean.

### alethiography.com

[alethiography.com](https://alethiography.com/)

This app is also made with Re-Frame using Bulma for CSS.  Form submission sends an email to me via Gmail SMTP gateway.
